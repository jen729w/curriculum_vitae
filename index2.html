      <h1>About me</h1>
      <div class="about-me__content">For 20 years I have worked in a diverse variety of roles across 50+ countries. I am now an NV2-cleared Project Manager based in Melbourne. I love to travel (but not full-time).</div>
      <div class="about-me__content">Incredibly process-driven, in 2010 I invented a system to organise projects which I use across every project I manage. It's called <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny.Decimal</a> and you should use it in your projects.</div>
      <div class="about-me__content">I'm a problem solver, and I'll get bored if there isn't something to do. </div>

      <h2 class="left">What am I looking for?</h2>
      <h2 class="right">What is my rate?</h2>
      <div class="about-me__content-left">
        <p>After just completing a 3-year project, I am looking for shorter-term contracts.</p>
        <p>I'd rather be smashed with a difficult project for a couple of months than become part of your furniture. IKEA is good for furniture. Me, not so much.</p>
        <p>Ideally you'll have something that will keep me busy for a couple of weeks to a couple of months.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-me__content-right">From $1,200&mdash;$1,500 per day, depending on:
        <ul>
          <li>The length of the contract</li>
          <li>The location</li>
          <li>The requirement for security clearance</li>
