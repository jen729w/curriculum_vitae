      <h1>About me</h1>
      <div class="about-me__content">For 20 years I have worked in a diverse variety of roles across 50+ countries. I am now an NV2-cleared Project Manager based in Melbourne. I love to travel (but not full-time).</div>
      <div class="about-me__content">Incredibly process-driven, in 2010 I invented a system to organise projects which I use across every project I manage. It's called <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny.Decimal</a> and you should use it in your projects (or hire me to do that for you).</div>
      <div class="about-me__content">I'm a problem solver, and I'll get bored if there isn't something to do. I'm a people person and I work by consensus rather than conflict. I'm a hard worker who puts his noise-cancelling headphones on and gets on with it.</div>

        <p>After just completing a 3-year project, I am looking for a shorter-term gig.</p>

        <p>Ideally you'll have something that will keep me busy for a couple of weeks to a couple of months.</p>

          <li>Do I need to mention <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny.Decimal</a> again? :-)</li>
          <li>I use <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> or <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> to track what I need to do, depending on my mood and the complexity of the project.</li>

          <li>For writing almost anything, it's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Plain-text is the future; I abhor MS Word.</li>
          <li>Keeping notes (in Markdown) is easy with <a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> (if you're able to sync to the internet), <a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html">ResophNotes</a> (if you're not), or <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a> (if you're mostly a macOS/iOS user and like pretty things).</li>
          <li>You can't beat a <a href="https://rhodiapads.com/collections_orange_black.php">Rhodia notepad</a> and a <a href="https://blackwing602.com/product/blackwing-pearl/">Blackwing Pearl pencil</a>.</li>
          <li>That all said, my general distaste for Microsoft products stops at the door of Excel. Excel is a beautiful thing and I could not live without it. I will not be modest about my Excel skills: I kill it.</li>
          <li>I prefer phone calls over email. My ideal job is one where I don't have an email account.</li>
          <li>I don't have a LinkedIn account. I had one but found its value to be <span class="strikethrough">questionable</span> nonexistent and the spam annoyed me, so I deleted it.</li>
