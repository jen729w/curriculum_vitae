      <div class="job-listing__job-details">I went to uni and, honestly, didn’t do a lot of work. Freedom, as an 18-year-old! Who wants to study?</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details">Fortunately my 3rd year was a placement year, and I ended up at Xerox. At the end of that year, my university weren’t so keen on having me back (due to my woefully poor academic performance) and Xerox weren’t so keen on having me leave (due to my exquisitely fine work performance). For me it was perfect&mdash;I loved work, I hated study.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details job-listing__job-details-last">And so, I didn’t finish my degree and I stayed at Xerox. It has turned out to be one of the most serendipitous decisions I’ve ever made; the Xerox job led to work all around Europe, which led to my job with The British Council which took me all around the world. You don’t get to travel the world on expenses in a graduate position, no sir.</div>

      <div class="job-listing__job-details">I grew up with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum+">Sinclair ZX Spectrum+</a>, moved up to the mighty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500">Amiga 500</a>, then it all went downhill as I spent my first student loan on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Dimension#XPS_series">Dell Dimension P90</a>.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details">I’m an old-school Wintel guy. My formative working years were spent with NT4 and Windows 95. Since then my professional career has followed the Microsoft path: I was a 3rd level sysadmin when Windows 2000/XP was all the rage, and I’ve put my time in at the Microsoft console. I know my way round Active Directory.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details">I know enough about a network to get by, though I wouldn’t call myself a network engineer. I <em>can</em> calculate a subnet using binary and a pencil, which surely counts for something.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details">For the last 5-or-so years, however, I’ve been off the tools. Now I’m more interested in helping the team that has their fingers on the console work as efficiently as they can, rather than doing it myself.

      <div class="job-listing__last_column_filler"></div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details job-listing__job-details-last">I like to keep things simple, and favour the following tools and methodologies.
        <ul>
          <li>Do I need to mention <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny.Decimal</a> again? :-)</li>
          <li>I use <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> or <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> to track what I need to do, depending on my mood and the complexity of the project.</li>
          <li>I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">the Pomodoro Technique</a> to focus on work. Turns out, on a <em>great</em> day you can get about 5 hours of actual work done. (Interesting experiment: I’ll only bill you the actual hours I work, like a lawyer. My rate will be higher as a result, but I think it would work out better for both parties.)</li>
          <li>For writing almost anything, it’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Plain-text is all we need; I abhor MS Word.</li>
          <li>Keeping notes (in Markdown) is easy with <a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> (if you’re able to sync to the internet), <a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html">ResophNotes</a> (if you’re not), or <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a> (if you’re mostly a macOS/iOS user and like pretty things).</li>
          <li>That all said, my general distaste for Microsoft products stops at the door of Excel. Excel is a beautiful thing and I could not live without it. I will not be modest about my Excel skills: I kill it.</li>
          <li>You can’t beat a <a href="https://rhodiapads.com/collections_orange_black.php">Rhodia notepad</a> and a <a href="https://blackwing602.com/product/blackwing-pearl/">Blackwing Pearl pencil</a>.</li>
          <li>Please don’t email me. I sit next to you! And if I’m not there, I have a phone! My ideal job is one where I don’t have an email account.</li>
          <li>I don’t have a LinkedIn account. I had one but found its value to be <span class="strikethrough">questionable</span> nonexistent and the spam annoyed me, so I deleted it.</li>

      <div class="job-listing__job-details">The current issue with <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny.Decimal</a> is that you need some sort of system to keep track of your database of numbers. I use Google Sheets at home and generally fall back to a SharePoint List when I’m working for someone else, but both solutions are clunky.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details">I need a custom solution, so I decided to build one. I’m in the process of teaching myself the core web technologies: HTML5 &amp; CSS3 (which I’ve used to hand-code the page you’re reading, from scratch), with Javascript &amp; Node.js/Express for actual application functionality.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details">The whole thing will be hosted on a Linode instance; I know enough *nix to maintain my own hosting services.</div>
      <div class="job-listing__job-details"><em>November 2018 update:</em> I'm looking back on this code that I wrote only six months ago and it’s embarrassingly bad. Now I’m learning React! Johnny.Decimal is still a work-in-progress, it’s iterated through vanilla JS, Node.js/Express, and now React.</div>
